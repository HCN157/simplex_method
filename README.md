Language: Python

Notation language: Chinese only

Introduction: This is initial version of my simplex LP solver, whose annotation is in Chinese and could only output process and intermediate variable values.
In the future I would add timer, profiling choices and optimize its proficiency while being faced with high-dimensional, sparse problems, providing other faster languages such as C++ and Julia and on-device options.
This may need a long time. 这是一个巨坑，先挖这以后慢慢填🕊
